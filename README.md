Coding projects I have completed until today

Here a description for every project.

## Transport in London
This was a group project for ST445 - Managing and Visualising Data at LSE. I worked in collaboration with Michele Bergami and Adleena Shakir.
We analysed some datasets about public transportation in London and we aimed at answering the following questions:

1. Which events impacted significantly the number of journeys on the entire TfL network over the years?
2. Are there any considerable events that made passengers switch across means of transportation?
3. How has overall trend of transport-related crimes in London changed over years 2009-2023?
4. What are the key factors influencing the number of TfL journeys?
5. Can historical data on TfL journeys be used to predict future passenger numbers accurately, and can we create a model to predict the number of TfL journeys in 2024?

We used visualisations, linear regression and SARIMA models.

My technical contribution was mainly on the creation of interactive plots, done with plotly.
